# burger

This burger eating app uses mysql, express, and handlebars to create a basic ORM.

This app accesses a mysql database in which it reads, updates and creates to and from.

The user can add any burger of their choosing by typing into the text box and clicking the submit button. Afterwards the burger is displayed on the left, or on top for small screens.

The user then has the option to devour their burgers which will send the burger to the devoured column.

The stylesheets are not being applied and the picture is not displaying because of an error I am unable to figure out.
